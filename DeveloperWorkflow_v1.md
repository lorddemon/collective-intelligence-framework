# Introduction #

Our developer workflow is done primarily through git and [github](https://github.com). More generalized information on how to contribute to a project:

Our cif-v1 repo can be found [here](https://github.com/collectiveintel/cif-v1). We've simplified the process from many submodules into a single tree to make the development process more fluid.

As always, feel free for help! Sometimes it's easy to create a fake project and test your git-foo in a sandbox first...
