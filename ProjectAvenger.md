The [Avenger Project](http://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/downloads/detail?name=CAPSTONE%20Final.pdf) was created to help give cyber professionals from industries across  the critical infrastructure community a collaborative cyber threat sharing environment at no  additional cost to them.  Bringing together the knowledge from all the various sectors builds a  more complete picture of what the cyber threat actually is and allows the analytical community  to determine the severity and confidence of threats.  With this more complete understanding,  analysts can better prevent both current and future network security attacks and decrease the  financial and data loss due to IT security breaches.

The Avenger System is based upon a model developed by the Research and Education  Networks Information Sharing Analysis Center (REN-ISAC) Security Event Manager. The tool the  REN-ISAC developed that is leveraged by the Avenger Project is the Collective Intelligence  Framework (CIF) tool.

NSS built upon this capability by adding a user web interface with  visualization tools for the initial operating capability.  Future development will include added  capabilities such as the inclusion of host-based security events; predictive, trend, and link  analytic tools; and the ability to develop comprehensive analytic reports.

The Avenger System  is not a competitor to already existing network monitoring commercial capabilities such as  SNORT, BMC Remedy, Orion Solarwinds, and HP ArcSight, but rather an additional knowledge  base of actionable threats that will enhance whatever commercial tools are being used, at no  additional costs.  In addition, in future phases, it will also provide business intelligence to  forecast attack trends in both structured and unstructured data stores to establish a more  robust and secure infrastructure.
